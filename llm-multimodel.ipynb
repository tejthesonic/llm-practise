      "The vast majority of the observed changes are directly attributable to the modification of the **\"Filter by property\"** from **\"Elite\" to \"All\"**.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Increase in Revenue and Bookings:** By switching from a specific property type (\"Elite\") to including \"All\" properties, the total data volume for revenue and bookings naturally increased significantly, as seen in the KPIs, city-specific revenue, and total bookings.\n",
      "*   **Changes in Percentages and Averages:** When aggregating data across all properties instead of just \"Elite\" ones, the overall occupancy percentage and average rating can shift. The slight decrease in \"Occupancy %\" and \"Average Rating\" suggests that the \"Elite\" properties might have, on average, slightly higher occupancy and ratings compared to the entire portfolio.\n",
      "*   **Consistent City Filter:** Even though the \"City\" filter remained \"Hyderabad\", the data displayed for Hyderabad changed because the underlying \"property type\" data affecting Hyderabad (and all other cities) changed from \"Elite properties in Hyderabad\" to \"All properties in Hyderabad\".\n",
      "*   The other filters (City, Status, Platform, Month) remaining constant confirms that their specific impact didn't change, and thus the changes are due to the 'Property' filter.\n"
